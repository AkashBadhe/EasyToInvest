          <p>
            As the name suggests, Equity Funds invest in the shares of different
            companies. The fund manager tries to offer great returns by
            spreading his investment across companies from different sectors or
            with varying market capitalizations. Typically, equity funds are
            known to generate better returns than term deposits or debt-based
            funds. There is an amount of risk associated with these funds since
            their performance depends on various market conditions.

            There are various ways of categorizing equity funds. Here is a look

              </a>
              – An Equity Fund might decide to follow a specific investment
              theme like an international stock theme or emerging market theme,
              etc. Also, some schemes might invest in a particular sector of the
              market like BFSI, IT, Pharmaceutical, etc. Here, it is important
              to note that sector or theme-based funds carry a higher risk since
              they focus on a specific sector or theme.

              of investing. These schemes analyze the market to find
              under-performing stocks and purchase them at low prices under the
              assumption that these stocks will recover in the long term.

            A Mutual Fund scheme is classified as an Equity Mutual Fund if it
            invests more than 60% (sixty percent) of its total assets in the
            equity shares of different companies. The balance amount can be
            invested in money market instruments or debt securities as per the
            investment objective of the scheme. Further, the fund manager can
            choose to invest in a growth-oriented or value-oriented manner and
            select companies according to his assessment of the investment
            generating maximum returns.

            Many new investors are wary of investing in the capital market since
            they are little capital to invest (young investors) or lack time to
            constantly monitor their investments (a must for share investments)
            or lack the expertise to choose the right shares. Hence, they turn
            to equity mutual funds. However, there are many{" "}
            <b>types of equity funds</b> available and choosing the right one
            can still be a challenge. We recommend most new investors to opt for
            Large-Cap Equity Funds. These schemes typically invest in the shares
            of the best companies in the market and have a history of generating
            consistent returns.

          <p>
            There is nothing much that we can say that you don’t already know!
            However, we recommend you to opt for diversified equity funds and
            take calculated risks. Your understanding of the market can help you
            choose the right scheme and earn higher returns as compared to other
            equity funds.

              Features of an Equity Fund

          </h2>
          <p>Here are some salient features of Equity Mutual Funds in India:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Lower Expense Ratio&nbsp;</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            In an Equity Fund, regular buying and selling of shares can lead to
            an increase in the expense ratio of the scheme. The Securities and
            Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has created an upper limit for the
            expense ratio of equity funds at 2.5%. Also, SEBI might reduce it
            further. This means more returns for investors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Tax Exemption under Section 80C</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Equity Linked Savings Scheme or ELSS offers tax exemption under
            Section 80C of the Income Tax Act with exposure to equity. It has a
            small lock-in period of 3 years and offers great potential for
            earning good returns. You can also invest in an ELSS in
            installments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Portfolio Diversification</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Equity Funds allow you to gain exposure to several good equity
            shares by investing a small amount. Hence, your equity portfolio is
            diversified and offers a better opportunity of earning good returns.

              <strong>Taxation rules of Equity Funds?</strong>
            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>In the case of Equity Funds, the taxation rules are as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Capital Gains Tax</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you hold the units of the scheme for a period of up to one year,
            then the capital gains earned by you are called short-term capital
            gains or STCG. STCG is taxed at 15%.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you hold the units of the scheme for more than one year, then the
            capital gains earned by you are called long-term capital gains or
            LTCG. LTCG above Rs.1 lakh is taxed at 10% without indexation
            benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT)</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This tax is deducted at source. Hence, when the mutual fund pays out
            dividends, it deducts DDT of 10% before distributing the dividend.

            </span>
          </h2>
          <p>
            When you decide to invest, apart from other choices, a big question
            faced by you is choosing between a lump sum and SIP investment plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lumpsum investment means that you invest the entire amount together.
            For example, if you want to buy units worth Rs. 5 lakh, then you can
            debit your bank account by the said amount and purchase the units.
            On the other hand, an SIP or Systematic Investment Plan means that
            you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both <a href="https://groww.in/p/lump-sum/">lumpsum</a> and{" "}
            <a href="https://groww.in/p/sip-systematic-investment-plan/">SIP</a>{" "}
            investing have their pros and cons. A lumpsum investor needs to
            invest at the right time to earn good returns. The risk is that if
            he times it wrong, then the returns can be lesser or he might even
            book losses. SIP investing helps mitigate this risk by allowing you
            to invest the same amount spread across a large period. This makes
            SIP investing affordable and flexible while inculcating the habit of
            investment discipline in you. Further, SIP investing also helps you
            benefit from Rupee Cost Averaging (RCA) where the average cost of
            purchasing a single unit reduces with time and you are safeguarded
            from market fluctuations.
